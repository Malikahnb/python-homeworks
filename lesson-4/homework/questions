2. What is the difference between the continue and break statements in Python?
 Break - this function completely stops the loop
 Continue - this function just skips one iteration and moves to the next iteration. It doesn't stop the loop

3. Can you explain the difference between for loop and while loop?
We can use for loop if we know how many iterations we need to make.
And 'while' can be used for the situations where we don't know how many exactly iterations we will have in our function

4. How would you implement a nested for loop system? Provide an example.
Well, nested loop is a loop inside the loop. Often used to create matrices.

Example:
'''
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    for j in range(i):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()

  '''
